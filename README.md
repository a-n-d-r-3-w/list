# list

**list** is a web application that allows the user to create, edit, delete, and move list items, as well as mark them complete. The UI is designed to be minimal, with elements appearing only when necessary.

The goal of this project is to practice using MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js, Gulp, Browserify, WebdriverIO, and Mocha.
